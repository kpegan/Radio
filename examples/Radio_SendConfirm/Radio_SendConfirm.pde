  Radio library example: send and confirm
  
  This program uses the Radio library to send a message via wireless 
  and then waits for a response. If if doesn't receive a response in 
  5 tries it assumes failure. The tranceiver used by the library
  is a Hope RFM12B FSK radio connected to an arduino/arduino clone 
  such as the JeeNode from http://jeelabs.net 
  
  When program is loaded on two arduino clones with a RFM12B tranceiver
  they take turns sending messages and sending confirmations.
 
  There is a 10 second interval between exchanges. 
  
  Arduino pins connected to RFM12B:
  
  2 RFM IRQ     Interupt pin from RFM12B
  10 SPI_SS     Chip select. 
  11 SPI_MOSI   Data output from Arduino
  12 SPI_MISO   Data input from RFM12B
  13 SPI_SCK    Clock input
  
  Note most Arduinos and clones run on 5V while the RFM12B runs on 3.3V
  before connecting an Arduino to the RFM12B be sure and account for this voltage difference.
